# airbnb-clone-project
This project is a full-stack Airbnb clone built to replicate the core functionality of the popular vacation rental platform. Users can browse listings, book stays, and manage their own properties through a sleek, responsive interface.

**Team Roles**
- Product Owner: Represents the client’s vision, prioritizes features, and ensures the product meets business goals.
- Project Manager: Oversees timelines, resources, and communication between stakeholders and the team.
- Business Analyst: Translates business needs into technical requirements and helps define project scope.
- UI/UX Designer: Crafts user interfaces and experiences that are intuitive and aligned with user expectations.
- Software Architect: Designs the system’s high-level structure and ensures scalability and maintainability.
- Software Developers: Write and maintain the codebase, turning designs and requirements into working software.
- Quality Assurance Engineers: Test the product to ensure it meets quality standards and is bug-free.
- Test Automation Engineers: Build automated testing frameworks to speed up and standardize QA processes.
- DevOps Engineers: Handle deployment, infrastructure, and continuous integration/delivery pipelines.

**Technology Stack**
• Django (Python Web Framework)A high-level framework for building secure, scalable web applications quickly.
- Comes with built-in features like ORM, admin panel, authentication, and routing.
- Ideal for enterprise platforms, REST/GraphQL APIs, and AI-enhanced backends.

• MySQL (Relational Database)A robust, open-source database system for storing structured data.
- Supports complex queries, joins, and transactions — perfect for analytics and reporting.
- Integrates seamlessly with Django’s ORM for efficient data handling.
  
 • GraphQL (API Query Language) A flexible alternative to REST that lets clients request exactly the data they need.

 **Database Design** 
- Reduces over-fetching and under-fetching, improving performance for mobile and web apps.
- Works well with Django via libraries like Graphene, enabling dynamic, schema-driven APIs.

**Feature Breakdown**

. User Management
Handles user registration, login, and profile management. This feature ensures secure access and personalized experiences for both hosts and guests, using role-based permissions to differentiate functionality.

. Property Management
Allows hosts to list properties with details like location, pricing, and availability. It forms the backbone of the platform, enabling dynamic property listings and updates.

. Booking System
Enables guests to book available properties for specific dates. It includes conflict checks, booking status updates, and calendar integration to streamline the reservation process.

. Payment Integration
Processes payments securely for confirmed bookings. This feature supports multiple payment methods and ensures transaction reliability, enhancing trust between users.

. Review & Rating System
Lets guests leave feedback on properties after their stay. Reviews help maintain quality standards and guide future guests in making informed decisions.

. Search & Filter
Provides users with tools to search properties by location, price, amenities, and availability. It improves user experience by helping them find the most suitable options quickly.

**API Security**

. Authentication
We use token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) to verify user identity. This ensures that only registered users can access protected endpoints and perform actions tied to their account.

. Authorization
Role-based access control (RBAC) restricts actions based on user roles (e.g., host vs. guest). This prevents unauthorized access to sensitive operations like property management or booking approvals.

. Rate Limiting
To prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks, we implement rate limiting on API endpoints. This protects the system from excessive requests and ensures fair usage across users.

. Data Protection
Sensitive data such as passwords are hashed using secure algorithms (e.g., bcrypt). All communication is encrypted via HTTPS to prevent interception and tampering.

. Payment Security
Payment endpoints are protected with additional validation and tokenization. This ensures financial transactions are secure and compliant with industry standards.

**CI/CD Pipeline**

- Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code. They ensure that every change pushed to the repository is verified and safely delivered to production, reducing manual errors and accelerating development cycles.

. Why CI/CD Matters

- Consistency: Automated builds and tests ensure code quality across environments.
- Speed: Faster deployments mean quicker feedback and shorter release cycles.
- Reliability: Reduces human error and ensures stable releases.
- Scalability: Supports growing teams and complex systems with minimal friction.

. Tools that you can use
1. GitHub Actions > Automates workflows like testing and deployment 
2. Docker > Containerizes the app for consistent environments 
3. Heroku / Vercel > Simplifies deployment to cloud platforms 
4. PostgreSQL / MySQL > Manages database migrations and backups
